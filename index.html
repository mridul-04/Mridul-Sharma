    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Education has undergone significant changes due to the <a
                href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> pandemic.
            This website explores the differences in educational methods before and after the pandemic, examining both
            challenges and new opportunities.</p>
        <p>In the pre-COVID era, traditional teaching methods dominated, relying heavily on in-person interactions and
            structured environments. However, the pandemic has catalyzed a transformation in education, prompting
            institutions to innovate and adapt rapidly.</p>
        <p>This comparison not only highlights the stark contrasts between the two periods but also emphasizes the
            lessons learned that could shape the future of education.</p>

    <!-- Pre-COVID Education Section -->
    <section id="pre-covid">
        <h2>Pre-COVID Education</h2>
        <p>Before the pandemic, education was primarily based on traditional classroom teaching. Schools, colleges, and
            universities conducted in-person classes, allowing students to interact face-to-face with teachers and
            peers.</p>
        <p>Key Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In-person classroom learning</li>
            <li>Direct interaction with teachers</li>
            <li>Fixed class schedules</li>
            <li>Limited use of technology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Life before COVID also included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social gatherings and events, fostering community engagement</li>
            <li>Limited online resources for learning</li>
            <li>Consistent school attendance policies</li>
        </ul>
